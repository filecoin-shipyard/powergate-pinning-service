## Overview

In this tutorial, we will build a simple pinning service using Textile Powergate.

A pinning service is a remote service that helps you manage your data (like a decentralized Google Drive). In this tutorial's context the data will be managed on Filecoin & IPFS.

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. Setup your own Powergate node.
2. Interact with Powergate using Powergate JS ClientÂ (@textile/powergate-client)
3. Create a simple pinning service which manages data for multiple users on IPFS & Filecoin.

Here is a sneak-peek of how the final application will look:

## App Architecture Overview

Below is the 10,000 feet overview of how our application will work:

1. A docker-compose script runs a Powergate, Lotus (filecoin client), and IPFS node.
2. A React dashbaord showing different features of the pinning service that uses Powergate JS Client to interact with the running powergate node.
